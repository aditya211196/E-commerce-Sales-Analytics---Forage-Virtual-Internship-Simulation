# E-commerce-Sales-Analytics---Forage-Virtual-Internship-Simulation

This project simulates a real-world business case for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), focusing on leveraging data visualization to generate executive insights for an online retail business. The objective was to support the CEO and CMO in strategic planning, particularly around revenue optimization, customer retention, and market expansion.

**Tools & Skills Used**
**Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

**SQL** – Query optimization for data validation and metric verification

**Excel** – Data cleaning and transformation

**Business Analytic**s – Executive insights, trend analysis, and recommendation framing

 **Work Performed**
**Data Cleaning:** Filtered out invalid entries (e.g., negative unit prices and quantities) to ensure data integrity using conditional logic in Excel.

Exploratory Analysis: Identified key business metrics including revenue trends, customer behavior, and country-wise performance.

**Dashboard Development:** Designed Power BI dashboards tailored to executive queries—monthly revenue trends, customer distribution, and geographic demand.

**SQL Validation:** All visual insights were backed by optimized SQL queries to ensure analytical accuracy.

**Executive Reporting:** Insights were structured to directly address business priorities such as market expansion and customer dependency.


 **Key Business Insights**
**Revenue Seasonality:**
Revenue remained steady at ~$685K/month for the first 8 months. A significant upswing was observed from September to November, peaking at ~$1.5M—indicating a strong seasonal trend. December data was incomplete.

**Top Markets for Expansion:**
Excluding the UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France showed the highest revenue and unit volumes, making them strong candidates for focused expansion efforts.

**Customer Base Structure:**
The top 10 customers showed a well-distributed revenue contribution, with only a 17% gap between the highest and second-highest contributors—implying low reliance on individual buyers.

**Geographic Sales Distribution:**
Outside the UK, Europe and Australia were high-performing regions. Asia, Africa, and Russia showed little to no demand, presenting long-term growth opportunities through targeted entry strategies.

**Outcome**
This project showcases how data visualization and analytics—when aligned with business strategy—can uncover growth levers, reduce risk, and improve decision-making at the executive level. The combination of Power BI visuals and SQL-based data validation ensured both clarity and credibility in insights.
